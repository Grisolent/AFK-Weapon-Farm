Equip the weapon you want to level up + a rocket launcher. 
If you are using a heavy weapon equip mountaintop instead as the second weapon.
If you are using a weapon that can slot the "Full Auto Retrofit" mod, slot it in.
Launch the autohotkey script that best corresponds the type of weapon you are leveling up.

Load up a Shuro Chi checkpoint.
Start the encounter and die.
Once the wipescreen is over and you have respawned press "9".
Enjoy
The script will run for as long as you don't press "0" which will stop the script.

It takes â‰ˆ2h to level up a weapon to level 16 using these scripts.
The only weapon type that the scripts works badly with is very low stability snipers.
The only weapon types that aren't covered by the scripts are non-heavy GLs and I can't be bothered to make one for them.

If you have any issues with the script head to the "Troubleshooting" file.

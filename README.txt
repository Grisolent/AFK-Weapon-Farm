This whole package was made to be able to farm levels for crafted weapons while being afk.

Preparation to use any of the scripts:
-Set game to fullscreen or windowed fullscreen
-Set game resolution to 1920x1080
-Set look sensitivity to 15
-Be on a hunter with Shadowshot Deadfall as your super
-Put the suppressor grenade on
-Put on stompees and 100 mobility
-Set your move forward to "w"
-Set your kinetic, energy and heavy weapons to "1", "2" and "3" respectively
-Set your interact to "e"
-Set your grenade to "q"
-Make sure you have raid banners

To setup the farm go to the "How to use" file
This farming method will work extremely poorly with fusion rifles, linear fusion rifles, swords.
If I ever make scripts for those they will be posted here: https://github.com/Grisolent
